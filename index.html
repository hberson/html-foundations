      Hi there! Thank you so much for your interest in my profile. I have always
      been fascinated with writing computer programs since I wrote my first
      program using flash (Adobe animator) while a sphomore in high school.
      Although I have attended and taking structured classes at DeVry University
      and Columbus Stateâ€”I am a self taught software engineer. Currently I am a
      Solution Architect at NetJets supporting three application teams focusing
      on external facing mobile and web applications. When I am not spending
      time with my family, I am architecting software for non-profit
      organizations, churches, hosting a podcast, and planning the launch of my
      startup.
    </p>
