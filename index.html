      Hi there! Thank you so much for your interest in my profile! I have always
      been fascinated with writing computer programs ever since I wrote my first
      program using flash (Adobe Animator) while a sophomore in high school.
      Despite having attended
      <a href="https://www.devry.edu/">DeVry University</a> and
      <a href="https://www.cscc.edu/">Columbus State</a>, I am a self taught
      Software Engineer, I do not hold a degree. I'm a college dropout.
      Currently I am a Solution Architect at
      <a href="https://netjets.com">NetJets</a> supporting three engineering
      teams focusing on externally facing mobile and web applications. When I am
      neither working nor spending time with my family, I am architecting
      software for non-profit organizations, churches, hosting a programming
      podcast, and working towards the launch of my startup. Feel free to
      connect with me on
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hberson/">Linkedin</a>!
